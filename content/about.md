## Why are we doing this?

This series of Synthesis Reports on the Guatemalan System of Environmental and Economic Accounts is the result of an effort to make its findings available to a broader non-Spanish speaking audience. The System includes information on energy, forests, water, ecosystems, waste, subsoil resources, fisheries, and environmental expenditure.

The Synthesis Reports summarize three documents that were published in 2009 for each of the accounts--one methodological, one of results, and one more informational--by the Central Bank of Guatemala and Rafael Landívar University. We feel that even if a few years have gone by and the numbers have evolved, key insights that were made possible by the accounts regarding the relationship between the environment and the economy in Guatemala will be everlasting.

Rather than translating these documents verbatim, we opted to slightly rewrite and reorganize their information having a general English reader in mind. This resulted in more concise documents with less of an academic tone, which policy makers and the general public will appreciate. 

We also tried to make them more suitable for the different ways in which people consume information. For that reason, each of the reports can be read online, downloaded as an e-book or PDF, or acquired in printed format.
