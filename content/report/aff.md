## What is an Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries account?

The System of Environmental-Economic Accounting for Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (SEEA AFF) is a framework that describes the relationship between the environment and the economy with an emphasis on agriculture, forestry and fisheries (FAO, 2015). 

On the one hand, it allows us to determine the level of stocks that are present in the production, processing and consumption of food, and other environmental services ascribed to agriculture, forestry, and fisheries. It also tracks the flows of natural inputs between the environment and the economy, as well as within the economy of these and other sectors. Finally, it also reflects environmental degradation that can occur from these exchanges.

## And what kind of information does it contain?

The SEEA AFF aims to keep track of the following data domains and base accounts:

* Agricultural products and related environmental assets
    * Physical flow account for crops
    * Physical flow account for livestock products
    * Asset account for livestock
	* Asset account for plantation crops
* Forestry products and related environmental assets
    * Physical flow account for timber and non-wood forest products
	* Asset account for forests
	* Asset account for timber resources
* Fisheries products and related environmental assets
    * Physical flow account for fish and aquatic products
	* Asset account for fish and other aquatic resources
* Water resources
    * Asset account for water resources
	* Physical flow account for water abstraction
	* Physical flow account for water distribution and use
* Energy 
    * Physical flow account for energy use
* Greenhouse Gas GHG emissions
    * Physical flow account for GHG emissions
* Fertilizers, nutrient flows and pesticides
    *Physical flow account for fertilizers
* Nitrogen and phosphorous budgets
    * Physical flow account for pesticides
* Land
    * Asset account for land use
	* Asset account for land cover
* Soil resources
    * Asset account for soil resources 
* Other economic data
    * Monetary supply and use table for agricultural, forestry and fisheries products
    * Extended production and income account for agricultural, forestry and fisheries activities

## Has it already been done for Guatemala?

We have conducted a trial run of SEEA AFF in Guatemala with the existing information of the SEEA Central Framework already present for 2010 in order to assess what was possible and identify information gaps that need to be worked on in more detail. Nonetheless, some of the preliminary findings are already revealing.

## What do we know about crops then?

For example, table 1 shows the output and import of various crops in metric tons for Guatemala in 2010. In terms of volume, sugar cane was by far the largest output of this group of products, followed by the production of bananas and maize. But if we were to take out sugar cane and bananas from this comparison because of their highly industrialized nature geared towards exports, we could quickly see that maize took up a third of the remaining products combined supply. Maize was followed closely by the group called "other vegetables" with a share of output of 16% and "other fruits and nuts" with 12% of this more limited group (without sugar cane and bananas).

It is also interesting to see that the production of beans, which are a staple food for Guatemalans, was not as large in terms of volume as that of maize. It represented 5% of total supply, which was comparable to wheat (6%), potatoes (6%), and other seeds and oily fruits (5%).

The external dependency of several products is also noteworthy. For example, most wheat was imported (99.7%). Also, 70% of unprocessed rice came from imports also. As much as maize has been a part of the Guatemalan diet for centuries, about 21% of it was imported. And even if supply of soy might not be important in terms of volume, a third of it came from imports.

**[Table 1. Physical supply account for crops. ABOUT HERE]**

In terms of use of the same products, we grouped economic activities in a way that would make it more easy to identify the steps of the food production chain. For that reason, we have industries that use crops as seed inputs, others that use it as feed for animals, we have the industrial production of food, hotels and restaurants, the remaining industries of Guatemala, households and exports.

Grouping industries that would naturally use crops as feed had the intention of addressing the concern of large portions of the earth's surface being cleared for the production of animal feed. Table 2 shows that the largest users of agricultural supply were manufactures, households, and the rest of the world (exports); not industries for feed. It would be reasonable to think that grain would be used by manufactures for the production of animal foods, but as we'll see volumes of those products were not relevant in the data.

**[Table 2. Physical use account for crops. ABOUT HERE]**

In the case of "soy" and "other live plants, flowers, and seeds," the data revealed no use as feed, but an important share of their volume was used as seed (40% and 38% of all uses, respectively).

## How important is the food processing industry?

Regarding the products with larger volumes in the economy, it is interesting to recognize the share used by manufacturing industries at the national level. For example, in the case of maize, only 20% of all used volume had a final destination in manufacturing. This is consistent with the 80% (adjusted to extract the negative stock variation) that was consumed by households. It contrasts with the 99% of the supply of unprocessed rice and wheat that were used almost exclusively by the food processing industries. This does not mean that households didn't consume such products. It only means that they got them in their processed versions, such as precooked white rice and dehydrated breakfast gruel. For this reason, the totality of sugar cane was used by the food processing industry.

Aside from these exceptions, households did consume large volumes of cultivated products directly, which is consistent with the traditional market culture still present in most of the country. For example, they used 95% of beans, 88% of potatoes, 97% of other roots and tubers, 99% of fresh culinary herbs, 91% of other vegetables and 67% of all fruits, among others.

**[Table 4. Supply of processed foods. ABOUT HERE]**

We take note of the relative importance in terms of volume of fruit juices (52,897 tm), other bakery and pastry products (44,885 tm), preserves, fruit marmalades, purees and fruit pastes (31,592 tm), as well as prepared or canned legumes (35,039 tm). It is noteworthy that in this last category we can find canned refried beans which are increasingly popular in Guatemalan diets.

As illustrative as the supply of foods is in understanding food security topics, evaluating the use of those foods within the economy has more explanatory power. Table 5 shows that households consume about 23% of the volume of prepared legumes, while 68% becomes exports, and it also shows that they use about 73% of canned fruits. It is also relevant that only 36% of processed rice goes to households, while 62% becomes exports. Households also use about 20% of wheat flour and 60% of other types of flour.

**[Table 5. Use of processed foods. ABOUT HERE]**

## What do we know about water and energy use in this context?

Ensuring food production requires that we ensure water availability during the various stages of crop growth. Table 6 shows the different requirements of land and water for crops. Among uses of water it is important to distinguish between irrigated and rainfed agriculture. In the first case, producers must make sure that there is enough available water of quality for crops to grow. In the second case, producers depend on the availability of rain water, the hydrological cycle, and climate variability. 

**[Table 6. Crops land and water use. ABOUT HERE]**

Maize production, as we've seen in volumetric terms before, is highly important to Guatemalans. It represents also the largest water use among crops (4.8 million m<sup>3</sup>), which is comparable to sugar cane production. Nonetheless, the water used for the production of this crop comes exclusively from rain (rainfed agriculture). This is also the case for the production of beans whose water use reaches 0.9 million m<sup>3</sup>.

Similarly, sugar cane has also a total water use of 4.8 million m<sup>3</sup>. This is, however, a more industrialized production which uses several methods of water use: 56% rainfed, 24% aspersion, 17% gravity, and 3% other methods.

Other relevant uses of water correspond with palm oil tree production (2.9 million m<sup>3</sup>, 52% of which come from irrigation), coffe (2.6 million m<sup>3</sup>, all rainfed agriculture) and bananas (1.4 million m<sup>3</sup>, 63% of which comes from irrigation).

Table 7 shows the use of energy of various sources in Guatemala. It is interesting that agricultural production, which does use a certain amount of gasoline and diesel, only represents about 1% of total energy use in the country.

It is more relevant to note that households use about 40% of the country's total energy use in the form of fuelwood. Judging by the 1% of total energy use that represent household gas or electricity use, it is implied that the main method of cooking in Guatemala is fuelwood.

**[Table 7. Energy use. ABOUT HERE]**

## What happens with fertilizers and nutrients in Guatemala?

Statistical work on the use of fertilizers is at a very early stage in Guatemala and so it can be complicated to supply information in the format proposed by the manual. However there are some estimations by FAO. For them:

  "Fertilizer consumption measures the quantity of plant nutrients used per unit of arable land. Fertilizer products cover nitrogenous, potash, and phosphate fertilizers (including ground rock phosphate). Traditional nutrients--animal and plant manures--are not included. For the purpose of data dissemination, FAO has adopted the concept of a calendar year (January to December). Some countries compile fertilizer data on a calendar year basis, while others are on a split-year basis. Arable land includes land defined by the FAO as land under temporary crops (double-cropped areas are counted once), temporary meadows for mowing or for pasture, land under market or kitchen gardens, and land temporarily fallow. Land abandoned as a result of shifting cultivation is excluded." (FAO 2016)
  
Table 8 shows a time series of this indicator for the years 2002-2013. We see a growing trend, going from 189 kilograms per hectare in 2010 and reaching 256 kg/ha in 2013.

**[Table 8. Fertilizer consumption. ABOUT HERE]**

There is little data regarding nutrients and waste in the Guatemalan SEEA. Under other efforts, there is a food balance sheet developed by the National Institute of Statistics for the year 2013, and even if it is impractical to reproduce it here, it is important to note that it has information on internal availability; losses and wastes; internal use; available food per year in metric tons; and supply of food and nutrients per inhabitant for:

1. cereals;
1. legumes;
1. sugars;
1. tubers and roots;
1. vegetables;
1. fruits;
1. meats;
1. eggs;
1. fish and seafood;
1. dairy products;
1. oils and fats;
1. fortified foods.

Figure 3 shows the evolution of the availability of daily calories per capita from vegetal and animal sources. In the years 2005-2013 87% of Guatemalans' caloric intake came from vegetal sources, and 13% from animal sources, in average.

**[Figure 3. Total available calories. ABOUT HERE]**

## What do we know about the economics of it all?

Table 9 shows the contribution of the different agricultural products to Guatemalan output in monetary terms for the year 2010. As we can see, the production of crops contributed around 9% of gross production, while cattle farming about 2%; the same as other agricultural products, forestry, and fisheries combined (2%). In total, all this production represents about 12% of the value added by the entire economy that year.

**[Table 9. Total supply in monetary terms. ABOUT HERE]**

Table 10 shows the use of the same products in monetary terms. Households buy 59% of crops, 80% of other agricultural products, but only 19% of the production of cattle farming. For this last category, 80% is destined to intermediate consumption by other industries. As for fisheries, 42% of total output is bought by households, 37% becomes exports and 20% intermediate consumption.

**[Table 10. Total use in monetary terms. ABOUT HERE]**

We now turn to extended production and income accounts for agricultural industries and the rest of the economy. Table 11 shows "taxes less subsidies" which represents monetary flows to the government in the form of taxes; net operating surplus, which collects profits from all companies; mixed income which is a mixture of self compensation and returns to capital of small business owners; compensation of employees; and value added, which is the total wealth generated by all economic activities in the accounting period.

## Final thoughts

We've seen how the information readily available from the System of Environmental and Economic Accounts of Guatemala can be used to implement an Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries account as proposed by FAO to a certain extent. While there are still a number of aspect that need to be covered by Guatemalan statistical efforts, some of the findings of this pilot implementation are already revealing. 

For example, it was interesting to learn that maize production in Guatemala depends entirely on rain water for its growth. This exposes the production of this crop to considerable risk in terms of climate variability, which contrasts with the fact that after sugar cane and bananas, maize is the largest production in terms of volume.

A similar argument can be made of beans, which also depend entirely on rain water. Beans cover a relevant portion of the Guatemalan diet, and it is interesting to see how canned legumes are increasingly used by households. This form of consumption of beans is ever more present in urban kitchens and it might represent a cultural shift that might increase the importance of industrial food processing in the food chain.

It is also important to note the sheer amount of land used by maize and beans. Even if we have no land quality considerations in the data, the low yields of the lands used for these crops, coupled with lower levels of technical development and no irrigation provide an explanation to the considerable amounts of land used for their production.

A number of products that have local markets are shown to be destined to the export market in their entirety. This might represent a compilation or estimation error. It is the case of vegetable oil, margarine, animal foods, bread, other bakery products, unrefined sugar from sugar cane, and molasses. Findings such as this one help improve the SEEA Central Framework of Guatemala.

In terms of energy, the most important finding is that while agricultural industries use negligible fractions of the total energy use of Guatemala (less than 1%), households do use about 40% of it in the form of fuelwood for cooking. Judging by the considerably less energy use of households in the form of liquefied gas and electricity, it is safe to imply that Guatemalan food is to a great extent cooked with fuelwood.
