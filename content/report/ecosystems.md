## What is a land and ecosystems account?

The Land and Ecosystems account is a framework that determines the current status of the different eco-regions of Guatemala in physical terms and quantifies the rate of their use through an analysis of land use change and its effects on forest cover. Furthermore, it identifies the economic stakeholders that drive those changes. 

Eco-regions are relatively large portions of the local landscape that hold specific arrangements of natural resources and species with limits that are close to the original extension of those arrangements prior to human intervention. In Guatemala, there are 14 of these regions and two of them represent 71% of the country's area. These are Rainforests of Petén-Veracruz (44%) and Pine-Oak forests of Central América (27%).

## What can we say about the current status of land use in those regions?

Forest cover reached 4.2 million hectares in 2003, which was about 39% of the country's area. Conversely, land used for agriculture represented about 28% of the territory, and a combination of pastures, grasslands, shrubs and bushes took up about 31%. The distribution of the different land uses within the eco-regions was highly irregular, and it is noteworthy that over 30% of the total area was destined for perennial and annual crops in 7 of the 14 regions.

There are large differences between regions. For example, the Yucatán Rainforest region had a forest cover of almost 78% in 2003, while the Dry forests of Central America had only about a 2% forest cover. Only five of the regions had a forest cover larger than the national mean, which revolved around 39%. These were the Rainforests of Petén-Veracruz (55%), the Rainforests of Yucatán (78%), **Bosques montanos de Centroamérica** (42%), 
Belicean Cost Mangroves (60%), and Northern Honduras Dry Mangroves (50%).

<!--**[Figure 3. Land use in Eco-regions of Guatemala (2003)]**-->

The area with more agricultural activity in detriment of the forest cover is the Pacific Basin. There are 1.48 million hectares under cultivation. This is 61% of its surface area and almost half of all agricultural land in the country (49.4%). Its forest cover represents only 12% of its area. In contrast, the Gulf of Mexico Basin has a forest cover of 49% of its surface area (about 2.5 million hectares of forests).

## How have forests changed?

In addition to understanding the current forest cover of a territory, it is illustrative to see how the forest has degraded over a certain period. In order to achieve this, we compare and contrast maps of forest cover built from satellite images. These maps require the work of several technicians from several institutions working together, and for this reason these maps are only published every few years. At the time of this comparison, only maps from 1991 and 2003 were available.

Guatemala lost 880,220 hectares of forest cover between 1991 and 2003, which represented a rate of deforestation of 17.3% for the entire period, relative to the forest cover in the first year. The main affected areas were the Rainforests of Petén-Veracruz with 540,215 hectares of forest cover lost, and the Pine-Oak Forests of Central America with 192,628 hectares. These regions accounted for 82% of all deforestation in those years. However, the Dry Forests of Central America region saw a most alarming rate of deforestation of 44%. At that pace, forest cover in that region could not last more than 20 years.

## Are these eco-regions capable of producing environmental services?

Evaluating the health of an ecosystem is a difficult task given the complexities of natural interactions. Nevertheless, there were indicators that we could use as proxies for ecosystem well-being. In that sense we evaluated forest density, forest fragmentation, and ecological integrity.

**Forest density** measures spatially the existence of forest cover in every square kilometer. The more dense a forest, the better its ecological integrity. The data showed that Guatemala's more dense forests--especially those with densities higher than 60%--, lost relevant portions of forest cover. The Gulf of Mexico Basin shows the most losses, with reductions of over 20%. Those area categories with no forest cover and those with densities lower than 40% showed increases of over 20%.
