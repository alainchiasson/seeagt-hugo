## What is a forest account?

The forest account of Guatemala is a framework that explains the relationship between forests and the economy. It puts together information on the status of forests and economic transactions associated with them in a systematic manner. It reveals the real contribution of forests to the national economy and the possible impacts that the economy might have on the well-being of forests.

More specifically forest accounting measures the stocks of the national forest inventory and the flows associated with it; it identifies the industries and stakeholders that benefit directly or indirectly from forests; it records expenditures made by government institutions in order to mitigate damages to and restore the well-being of forests; and extend macro-economic aggregates and indicators in order to reflect the depreciation of the forest resources.

## What's the status of forests in Guatemala?

In order to answer this question we turn to the change of forest land stock in comparison with 1970 and to an indicator of this change relative to population (forest land stock per capita). As for changes in land stock, by 2005 Guatemala had lost close to 40% of its 1970 availability. More illustrative is the fact that due to high population growth rates, availability of forests per capita have dropped in a relevant way.
