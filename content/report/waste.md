## What is an environmental account for waste?

The environmental account for waste is a framework that describes in detail the production, reuse, disposal and the various types of residuals generated by the different stakeholders in the economy. It makes a link between information on solid residuals and economic indicators. More specifically, it:

1. Records the physical flows of residuals from the economy to the environment and within the economy.
2. Accounts for the level of expenditure made by the government for the management of residuals.
3. Provides a set of indicators in order to monitor economic performance and waste production.
